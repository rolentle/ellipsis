# ellipsis...

What is ellipsis...? Ellipsis is fourth iteration of my dotfiles and explanation of everything in it. Traditionally I have been a bad developer and just added junk to my dotfiles by copy and pasting. Not understanding the things I was adding to my dotfiles caused them to easily break and I didn't understand why they broke or how to fix them.

## Terminals

While traditionally I have used [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal, I am now experimenting with [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#) due to its [kittens](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#kittens) framework.
